# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a lightweight HTTP service in Go that can run as a cross-platform binary on Windows and Linux. The service provides configurable routing to local file system paths with optional basic authentication, and includes service management capabilities for easy installation and removal as a system service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to run the HTTP service as a single binary on both Windows and Linux, so that I can deploy it easily across different environments without dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the binary is executed THEN the system SHALL run on both Windows and Linux operating systems
2. WHEN the binary is built THEN the system SHALL produce a single executable file with no external dependencies
3. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL initialize without requiring additional runtime components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want command line options to install and uninstall the service, so that I can manage it as a system service without manual configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the binary is executed with --install flag THEN the system SHALL register itself as a system service
2. WHEN the binary is executed with --uninstall flag THEN the system SHALL remove itself from system services
3. WHEN installation occurs THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate service startup behavior for the target OS
4. WHEN uninstallation occurs THEN the system SHALL clean up all service-related configurations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want to configure hostname, port, and authentication settings, so that I can control access and network binding for the HTTP service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration for hostname and port binding
2. WHEN basic auth is configured THEN the system SHALL require username and password for all requests
3. WHEN anonymous access is configured THEN the system SHALL allow requests without authentication
4. WHEN invalid credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 Unauthorized
5. WHEN configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults (localhost:1123, anonymous)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want to configure a list of file system paths with corresponding URL routes, so that I can serve different directories through specific HTTP endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a route is configured THEN the system SHALL map the URL path to the specified file system directory
2. WHEN a request matches a configured route THEN the system SHALL serve files from the corresponding directory
3. WHEN a request path does not match any route THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found
4. WHEN a file exists in the mapped directory THEN the system SHALL serve the file with appropriate MIME type
5. WHEN a directory is requested THEN the system SHALL serve an index file if present or return directory listing
6. WHEN a file does not exist in the mapped directory THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 404 Not Found

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a service operator, I want the service to handle configuration through a config file, so that I can modify settings without recompiling the binary.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a config file
2. WHEN the config file is missing THEN the system SHALL create a default configuration file
3. WHEN the config file is malformed THEN the system SHALL log an error and use default values
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL require a service restart to apply changes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper logging and error handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor service health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the service starts THEN the system SHALL log startup information including configuration
2. WHEN requests are processed THEN the system SHALL log request details with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with sufficient context for debugging
4. WHEN running as a service THEN the system SHALL write logs to appropriate system locations
5. WHEN running in console mode THEN the system SHALL output logs to stdout/stderr
